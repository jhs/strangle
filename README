This package is for parsing DNS messages as you would see them from a network
capture or your own network application.  It is a Python interface to the
libbind DNS message parsing library.

A useful reference for this software is DNS and BIND, 5th Edition from
O'Reilly.

== INSTALLATION ==

Strangle is a standard distutils-driven Python package.  It also has a
C language component that must be compiled against the BIND parsing
library (libbind).  For Debian, you need the "bind-dev" package,
as well as standard C development packages (gcc, libc6-dev, etc.).  for
RPM-based distributions, try the bind-devel package.

1. Uncompress the archive that you have downloaded.  By default, it will
   extract to a directory named Strangle-<something>.
2. Change to that directory and run the install command:

   # python setup.py install

3. Everything should compile properly and you should be able to use the
   Strangle library from any location in your system.

   >>> import Strangle
   >>> Strangle
   <module 'Strangle' from '.../site-packages/Strangle/__init__.pyc'>
   >>>
