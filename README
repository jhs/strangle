This package is for parsing DNS messages as you would see them from a network
capture or your own network application.  It is a Python interface to the
libbind DNS message parsing library.

A useful reference for this software is DNS and BIND, 4th Edition from
O'Reilly.

== INSTALLATION ==

Constrict is a standard distutils-driven Python package.  It also has a
C language component that must be compiled against the BIND parsing
library (libbind).  For Debian Sarge, you need the "bind-dev" package,
as well as standard C development packages (gcc, libc6-dev, etc.)

1. Uncompress the archive that you have downloaded.  By default, it will
   extract to a directory named Constrict-<something>.
2. Change to that directory and run the install command:

   # python setup.py install

3. Everything should compile properly and you should be able to use the
   Constrict library from any location in your system.
